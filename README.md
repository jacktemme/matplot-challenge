## Data Visualization Challenge

This repository takes data from an experiment testing different anti-cancer medictations on mice. The purpose of this experiment is to determine how effective these drugs are on treating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which is is a common type of skin cancer. The data for this experiment can be found in the "data" folder with the data analysis in the Jupyter Notebook file. The progam language of Python was used for this analysis along with the pandas and matplot library for data manipulation and visualization. The main findings of this analysis are written in this file as well.
